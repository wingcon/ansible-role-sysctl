# Role default lower priority variables

# List of dict  contining the sysctl files to create an their options. The
# format of the dict is the following:
#
# {
#  - name: <name>                   # For identification purposes
#    path: <path>                   # Path to the sysctl config file (optional)
#    options:                       # List of dict with options to apply
#      - ignoreerrors: <boolean>
#        name: <option name>
#        reload: <boolean>
#        state: <present or absent>
#        sysctl_set: <boolean>
#        value: <option value>
# }
#
# The attributes in `options` list dicts have the same meaning that in  ansible
# `sysctl` module
#
# Sample:
#
# sysctl:
#   - name: main
#     options:
#       - name: kernel.printk
#         value: 3 4 1 7#
#       - name: net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6
#         value: 1
#   - name: hardlinks
#     path: /etc/sysctl.d/50-hardlinks.conf
#     options:
#       - name: fs.protected_hardlinks
#         value: 1
#         state: present

sysctl: []

# Dicitionary with the defaults options to use if no other ones are specified in
# the `options` attribute of the items in `sysctl`variable.

sysctl_options_defaults:
  reload: yes
  sysctl_set: yes
  state: present

# Indicate `sysctl` must be loaded also from host variables. Any host variable
# that begins with "sysctl_*" and contains the necessary attributes
# will be loaded as an item to manage by the role. The variables must follow the
# structure detailed before for `sysctl`

sysctl_load_from_hostvars: no
